Born to a police inspector father and a music teacher mother, Pradeep Kumar grew up in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. His mother, Lalitha Vijayakumar, taught Carnatic music through private lessons and at a government school in the area, meaning that Pradeep Kumar was constantly exposed to Carnatic music as a youngster and often joined his mother in singing at home. He later was introduced as a playback singer in Tamil cinema through the film Attakathi by Santhosh Narayanan He later began studying music under J. Venkataraman from the Aalathur School of music, who became his first guru.</p>
